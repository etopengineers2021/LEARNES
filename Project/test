1. Calculator
    a. Arithmetic operations ( add, sub, mul, div, modulo ( remainder ) )
    b. conversion operations ( Decimal -> Bin/Hex/Oct, Bin-> dec/Hex/Oct, Hex-> dec/bin/Oct, Oct-> dec/bin/hex )
    c. bit-wise operations ( AND, OR, ~ NOT, ex-OR, NAND, NOR, shift(Arithmetic, Logical), rotate(Circular, Carry Circular) )
    c. logical operations only boolen(0 and 1) . ( &&, ||, ! ) .
2. Tracking
    a. count of different types of operations ( how many arithmetic, conversion, bit-wise and logical opeartions )
    b. store all the operations performed to file ( database ).
